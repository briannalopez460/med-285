      Sidney Bueno, a proud 54-year-old Dominican man from the Bronx, created El Metro Salsero as a way to share his love for Latin music with the world. Hosting this radio station has become his favorite hobby. He's passionate about salsa and other Latin rhythms, and he believes in giving new musicians a platform and opportunity to be heard. Over the years, he’s met several famous Latin artists and continues to build connections across the music world. His voice, energy, and deep knowledge of Latin music keep listeners coming back for more.
